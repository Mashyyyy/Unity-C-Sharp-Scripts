# Unity C# General Purpose Scripts

## Overview
This folder contains all General Purpose C# scripts made for Unity Engine.
- What I mean by General Purpose is that they do not serve a specific purpose and can be modified to fit the program/game you make, additionally, they are easy to       understand from a developer's standpoint and includes comments from the developer.

## Using as a Developer for Unity
You may use this C# scripts in your own projects, commercial or personal, and you may choose to credit the main contributor or not for the architecture of the program.
But do not claim the scripts as your own or flag the scripts as fraudulent.

## Using as a General Developer
Some of the architecture of the program are purely based on Unity's built-in implementation but may include some general C# logic for functions and other System Collections for C#.
