# Unity-C-Sharp-Scripts
A handful of Unity C# Scripts that can be re-used for future projects and as a reference for other scripts.

## Important Note
- These scripts are free to use and modify in any way to fit your needs, but do not claim them as your own and flag them as fraudulent and infringe any property. I personally created the architecture of the code and only used references for the material itself, it may not completely original but it is my own craft.
